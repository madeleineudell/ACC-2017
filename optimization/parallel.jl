##### embarrassingly parallel computation is embarrassingly easy

# This computation is automatically distributed across
# all available compute nodes, and the result, reduced by summation (+),
# is returned at the calling node.

# at the command line,
# export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4

Threads.nthreads()

# simple example
a = zeros(10)
